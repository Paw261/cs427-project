# Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1

The purpose of this application is to play around with music, MIDI and synthesize your own songs. Your are able to do the following:
- Upload midi file for editing.
- Add new instruments in the control panel at the bottom.
- Add new sounds in the main window in the middle which connects to the current instrument, which is shown at the bottom.
- Add filters, spatial, wavetype and volume restrictions to each individual instrument.
- Basic control over the current song (Play, pause, resume, restart and overall volume control).

In addition to that an easily understandable visual view of the song is available in the middle section.
A build version can be experienced at `http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~pfc226/CS427Project/project/`.
A MIDI file for testing can also be downloaded at `http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~pfc226/CS427Project/project/temp.mid`.

The project relies heavily on Angular, aswell as RxJS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
